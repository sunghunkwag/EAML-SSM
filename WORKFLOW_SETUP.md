# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

The CI workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` but could not be pushed automatically due to GitHub App permissions.

To enable CI/CD for this repository, please manually add the workflow file through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/sunghunkwag/EAML-SSM
2. Navigate to "Actions" tab
3. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
4. Copy the content from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your local repository
5. Commit the workflow file

Alternatively, you can push the workflow file using a personal access token with `workflow` scope.
